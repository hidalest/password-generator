- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This project was really challenging for me because I wanted to do it with TS without really knowing TS so I had to learn "on the fly" while doing the project.

I had to read a lot of stuff when facing an error about TS and, of course, most likely this project will not follow TS best practices but it helped me have an understanding and an idea about how TS is supposed to be used and how it works.

Also when finishing the project and realized that I overcomplicated things with the "password strength measure" component and I could just use regex and save some time.

### Continued development

Definitely need to learn more about TS, on this project I felt I didn't utilize the full power of this technology. For my next project and will be ready to use TS with stronger knowledge and best practices
